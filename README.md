# :cat: Cat Recognizer

This project is a Python program that uses OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) to detect cats in images. 

## About The Project

OpenCV is a library used mainly for computer vision. While researching facial recognition software, and how to build it, I discovered something even more fun! Cat recognition software. For a cat lover, this was an amazing discovery.

I began by following a facial recognition tutorial to understand the basics of how OpenCV's resources work. Then, I modified it to work with Haar Cascades' cat recognition tool.

I tested this with a variety of different cat photos (taken by myself and @su.and.ran and @nabesentochiro on Instagram). Some of the photos had one cat, while others had multiple. 

Using Haar Cascades' cat recognition tool, I got varying results. While it always recognized the cat in the photo, it also falsely recognized other non-cat portions of the photo as well. 

After more research, I found an alternative tool: LBP Cascades. I implemented the same program with LBP Cascades. The following tables provide information on how these tools performed with the six sample cat photos.
